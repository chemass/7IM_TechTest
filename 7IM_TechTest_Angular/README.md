# Angular project

Simple angular project to query and display results from the backend project.
use 'ng serve' or the provided '..\start_frontend.bat' file to start. The backend application must be running.

No real styling has been attempted, as most of my designs will make your eyes bleed! A modicum was done in the person card component to show that I understand the concept.

Some simple tests are included, and can be run using 'ng test'. Having not done any Angular work for several years, I've again simply shown that I understand the concepts around testing of components without attempting to provide a full suite of tests to exhaustively test all aspects.
